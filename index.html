        <h3>About Me</h3> 
        <p>My full name is Kevin Feng and I am currently a 17 year old senior at Brooklyn Technical High School. I was born in New York but spent much of my childhood growing up in Fu Zhou, China, where both of my parents are from.  Growing up in rural China really give me a love of nature, from catching frogs to chasing chickens around. When I was 6 years old, I moved back to the US and started life in NYC, where I have lived up to now. My favorite hobby is chess, and I have special interests towards Computer Science, Environmental Science and History. </p>
